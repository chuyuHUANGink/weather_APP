Motivation and aims:
Clothing drying is a common part of our daily life, and it’s important to pick an appropriate time. There are lots of factors we should concern includes weather, temperature, humidity, wind, sun ……it would be much easier to have an application that automatically take these factors into consideration then  schedule it for users..

This project will develop a mobile application that take users geographic information/time as input, and find appropriate time within next couple days to do the outside clothing drying base on weather conditions.
